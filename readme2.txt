This is not a tutorials. There are my codes created for the request below:

Create a basic webpage that includes an input form. JavaScript is to be embedded into your HTML document.

The input form should include:

    Field for user name input
    Field for order quantity input
    Read only field for item price – set to a value of 5.31
    Read only field for order total cost
    “submit button” that does NOT use any type of form button element

User should be able to input their name and order quantity, then click “submit”.  When “submit” is clicked, form will calculate an order total, including sales tax of 8.25%.  Once calculated, the order total form field is to be updated with a total, including dollar sign and two decimal places. An alert box should also be triggered stating the users name and a message indicating the order total including sales tax.
